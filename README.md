Batchiepatchie
---------------

Batchiepatchie is a service built on top of AWS Batch that collects information
on all the jobs that are running and makes them easily searchable through a
beautiful user interface. Internally, Batchiepatchie mirrors the state of AWS
Batch in a PostgreSQL database. It can scale for millions of jobs and for many
use cases is a substantial improvement over AWS Management Console for AWS
Batch.
